Sales performance analysis using RFM Model in PowerBI.

# overview



## KPI Design
Recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) is a model used in marketing analysis that segments a company’s consumer base by their purchasing patterns or habits. 
In particular, it evaluates customers’ recency (how long ago they made a purchase), frequency (how often they make purchases), and monetary value (how much money they spend)

## lesson learned

Creating each KPI using DAX in Powerbi.
Customer Segmentation: RFM analysis helps segment your customer base into distinct groups, allowing you to tailor your marketing strategies to each segment's characteristics and needs. This personalization can lead to higher engagement and conversion rates.

Identifying High-Value Customers: By analyzing the monetary value (M) of customers' purchases, you can identify those who contribute the most revenue to your business. This allows you to focus your efforts on retaining and nurturing these high-value customers.

Targeted Marketing Campaigns: RFM segments provide insights into customer behavior. You can design targeted marketing campaigns based on the recency (R) and frequency (F) of their purchases. For example, you could send re-engagement offers to customers who haven't made a purchase in a while or loyalty rewards to frequent shoppers.

Retention and Churn Prevention: RFM analysis helps you identify customers who have lapsed in their purchasing behavior (low recency) or are decreasing in frequency. This enables you to implement retention strategies to prevent churn, such as offering special incentives to win back their business.

Resource Allocation: Not all customers are equally valuable to your business. RFM analysis helps you allocate resources effectively by focusing your marketing and customer service efforts where they will have the most impact, thus optimizing your return on investment.

Product Development and Inventory Management: Understanding customer preferences and purchase frequency can guide product development and inventory management decisions. You can stock up on products that are popular among high-value customers and tailor your offerings to match customer preferences.

Customized Customer Experiences: Knowing your customers' purchasing patterns enables you to provide tailored experiences. For instance, you can suggest products related to their past purchases, enhancing the likelihood of upselling and cross-selling.

Measuring Marketing Effectiveness: RFM analysis allows you to gauge the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns by tracking changes in customer behavior over time. You can measure whether your efforts are increasing recency, frequency, and monetary value among different customer segments.

Data-Driven Decision Making: RFM analysis provides concrete data that can guide your decision-making processes. It helps you move beyond assumptions and make informed choices based on actual customer behavior.

Improved Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): By leveraging RFM insights, you can improve customer satisfaction and retention, ultimately leading to an increase in customer lifetime value. High CLV is a strong indicator of a healthy and successful business.

Overall, RFM analysis empowers businesses to understand and engage with their customers more effectively, leading to improved marketing strategies, increased customer loyalty, and better financial outcomes.
